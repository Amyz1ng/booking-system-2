# Booking system
You can find the Live site [here](https://amyz1ng.github.io/Booking-system-/)

This website I have created is for a restaurant of my own creation, i used the menu from my first project 1 of Pizza-berra and made a live site with a booking system. 
I have made it for a wide target audience of food lovers who also enjoy drinking, I wanted to encorporate a mix and match idea so that it would suite everyone's satisfaction.
Whether it's to just come in and relax, have a pint or to come and enjoy a luxurios meal!

Users of the website can find all the infomation they need to know about my restaurant, such as how to be in contact, opening times and days we operate, our social media for updates on specials and make reservations.

## Design  
### Colour Scheme  
Colours used I wanted to stick to a tasty colour palette for this site, utilizing the hero image background as much as possible to draw a user in and give a direct understanding to the website from the get go of launch.
The contrast of colours used help the user to navigate through the website with ease as it is easy to read and stands out.

### Imagery  
Visual representations are an important part of the user experience for this project, used to draw a potential client in.

The welcome  image is used to convey a feeling of a broader sense of Palate, rather than be informative.
The logo in the header is used to build the business brand, a simple icon that can be used across multipl platforms.

### Overall Feel  
The main objective in creating the site was to have it look elegant and simplistic for easy navigation, while still providing the user with all of the information one would want at first sight.

# FEATURES  
## Current Features  
At the top of the page I have my navigation bar, which contains the Home, Menu,Contact and Download.

Navigation on Social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) which will open in new tabs to each individual social media's.
